WackDonald's is a small cooking and serving game where the player prepares meals and serves them to customers.
The player can move around the restaurant, pick up ingredients, use kitchen stations, assemble trays, and deliver completed meals.

Customers arrive and sit at chairs.
When the player gives a customer a completed meal tray, the customer becomes satisfied and leaves.

The goal of the game is to serve as many customers as possible within the session.
